# React Native Course

Welcome to my React Native Projects Repository! This repository contains various projects that I developed while learning React Native. As an iOS developer proficient in Swift, I decided to explore React Native to keep up with the dynamic trends in the market, where cross-platform solutions are gaining popularity. This journey has allowed me to gain a better understanding of different technologies and be more aware of their pros and cons.
